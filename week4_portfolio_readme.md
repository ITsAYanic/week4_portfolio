## Target
To build a portfolio website with Vue3 + Vite.

## What went wrong?
I underestimated Vue, Devcontainers and how little time I have. Plus I got distracted. Instead of developing a portfolio, I switched my homelab from a old laptop with Ubuntu Server to a Mac Mini. I also spent to much time on the posters which I didn't finish.
Now I have a Server but no website.

## To do:
Plan better and actually focus!
